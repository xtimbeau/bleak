# Project Bleak (*Botched Legislation for the Earth: Assessments and Knowledge*)

Project Bleak is a collaborative inventory of failed and unsuccessful environmental policies

We need to learn from failed attempt to implement Environmental Policies. Our hypothsesis is that when en environmental policy fails there is a pattern that can reproduce itself. 
Identifying those patterns is the way to design better policies.

The work has started in January 2026 and is open to students of EAP master EoE course by X. Timbeau and A. Saumtally.

The goal is to :

-     build a database of environmental policies, failed or successful anywhere on the planet, at any moment in time 
-     document all evaluations and analysis of the policies 
-     identify the factors that provoke failure
-     propose guidelines to avoid failure in the future
